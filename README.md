# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Implementation Details

- I used the Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm, which was given as a template, with small modifications. 
- I tried different activation functions, incuding leaky ReLU (slope: 0.2) in order to avoid dying ReLU problems and a small l2-regularization on the weights. 
- The following hidden layers were used:

`Net: (64 units, ReLU), (64 units, ReLU)`

Final values of hyperparameters:

```
BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e5)
BATCH_SIZE = 64       
GAMMA = 0.9           
TAU = 5e-3            
LR = 5e-4             
UPDATE_EVERY = 10     
```

### Getting Started

1. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) to install Unity ML-Agents. 
2. Navigate to the `p1_navigation/` folder, and run the command below to obtain a few more packages.

```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

   - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
   - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
   - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

   (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

   If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.
